# Clock

You are required to build an Analog watch with hour, minute, and second hands. A button
should be present that will switch that Analog watch into a digital one with the hour, minute, and
period of the day (AM or PM) being shown in the same place where the analog watch was. The
digital watch itself can be switched to a 24-hour format or a 12-hour format. User should be able
to set an alarm for a particular time, which should play some music when the clock reaches the
alarm point (keeping in mind the format in which the alarm time is added).
